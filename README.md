## üìå Overview
This repository documents my **Summer Internship Project (SIP)** carried out at the **Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital** under the mentorship of **Prof. Kaushik Gopalan (FLAME University)** and **Mr. Samaresh Bhattacharjee (ARIES)**.  

The internship focused on building a **web-based analytical platform** for exploring and forecasting weather patterns using high-frequency data from Automated Weather Stations (AWS). The final product combined **data engineering, visualization, and machine learning** to produce actionable climate insights.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Due to organizational policy, the **source code and raw data cannot be shared publicly**. This repository serves as a **project showcase** with documentation, methodology, outcomes, and reflections.

## Project Goals
- Preprocess and clean AWS weather data (2017‚Äì2025).  
- Create scalable **MySQL databases** for structured storage and aggregation.  
- Develop an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for:
  - Data exploration  
  - Trend analysis  
  - Rainfall classification (as per IMD standards)  
  - Anomaly detection  
- Integrate **machine learning models** (Random Forest, SVR, Linear Regression, LightGBM, Decision Tree) for rainfall and temperature forecasting.  
- Deploy a user-friendly platform for researchers, policymakers, and students.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, scikit-learn, LightGBM  
- **Web App Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Database:** MySQL (with SQLAlchemy integration)  
- **Report Generation:** ReportLab, python-docx  
- **Deployment Tools:** Render, Railway  

---

## Key Outcomes
- Designed **dual dashboards** (AWS1: Manora Peak, AWS2: ST Radar) with real-time visualizations.  
- Implemented **rainfall classification** based on IMD guidelines.  
- Developed **predictive models** ‚Üí Random Forest consistently achieved the best results.  
- Enabled exportable reports (PDF & Word) with visualizations and model comparisons.  
- Detected meaningful environmental insights:
  - **Post-2020 warming of temperature extremes**  
  - **Altered monsoon patterns** (earlier onset, delayed withdrawal)  

---

## Learnings & Reflections
- End-to-end project management: from raw **data engineering** ‚Üí **ML integration** ‚Üí **web deployment**.  
- Balancing **accuracy, usability, and performance** in an applied data science project.  
- Gained experience in **interdisciplinary research**, where data science meets environmental studies.  
- Strengthened interest in **data-driven sustainability solutions** and public-good applications.
